# 👋 Hi, I'm Tim!

<q><i>Coding isn't only about hacking a colourful line after another - it's about creating something new together with anyone who shares my passion</i></q>

### 👉🏼  Welcome to my GitHub space where I love to create and share things that blend functionality and aesthetics.


## 👨‍💻 A bit about me...

I'm a Software Developer and I'm really into the whole idea that coding isn't just about writing code, it's about creating something interesting, useful, and even beautiful. Currently, I'm putting a lot of my energy into learning and developing my Fullstack and project management skills. 

JavaScript, React, Node.js, Nest.js... you name it, I'm probably trying to learn something new about it. It's a bit of a journey, but I love the process and seeing how everything fits into the bigger picture - piece by piece. 

If you want to chat about technologies, or have an interesting project idea in mind, I'd love to hear from you. Reach out at via linkedIn.

## 🐶 When I'm not coding...

I'm a big fan of music - it's my go-to when I'm in need of some inspiration or relaxation. And when I'm not lost in the music or tangled in lines of code, you'll find me spending time with my new best friend, an Australian Shepherd puppy (trust me, she's the cutest!) - oh and her name is Pixel (since Java was already taken by another fella).
