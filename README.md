# 👋 Hey,  <br />
Welcome to my GitHub page. Please, make yourself comfortable and take a look around! 😎 <br />
I'm a web developer from Hamburg, Germany and this might help to get to know me and my way of working just a little bit better.

## 💻 How I work

> “Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier” - Mother Theresa

There are two things that are most important to me:

1. 🌸 **Harmony & transparency** <br /> I believe in working together in an empowering and constructive way, rather than blocking each other's growth. Let's empower each other, grow together, and share our knowledge to make this world a better place!

2. 🏗️ **Proper conceptualisation & organisation** <br /> As a developer, I know how important it is to tackle new challenges effectively. That's why I focus on proper feature conceptualisation to avoid clashes between expectations and implementation. Happy people, happy me! ☀️
