# 👋 Hey there, I'm Tim!

I'm a freelance 🌐 web developer who values harmony & transparency, conceptualisation, and sharing of knowledge. My goal is to work with startups and tech for good companies who share these values and want to make a positive impact on the world. 

## 💻 How I work

My work is guided by the following principles:

1. 🌸 **Harmony & transparency**: I believe that working together in an empowering and constructive way is essential for success. Let's build each other up, grow together, and share our knowledge to make the world a better place.

2. 🏗️ **Conceptualisation first**: As a developer, I know that tackling new challenges requires proper conceptualisation. That's why I focus on creating a solid foundation before diving into implementation.

3. 💡 **Sharing is caring**: I'm always eager to share my knowledge and learn from others. Let's collaborate, share ideas, and create something amazing together.
