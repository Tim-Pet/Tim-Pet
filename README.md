There are two most important things you should know about me:
1. Harmony & transparency are key
2. Proper conceptualisation & organisation makes your dream work (and teamwork as well of course)

**👇 But let me elaborate: 👇**

### 🌸 Harmony & transparency
Well, you might think harmony & transparency, that is a sign of weakness, of a person, who doesn't like to discuss issues, strctures, whatsoever. But you may stop here because that is not what I am talking about. <br /> <br /> 
Harmony & transparency is used as a synonym for an empowering & constructive co-operation. <br /> <br /> 
I believe that the tech world is evolving too fast and learning is too much of a daily hustle to block anyones motivation, dedication or pace by trying to block anyone to outgrow him-/herselve! Rather empower each other, grow together & share your knowledge whereever you can to leave this place a little bit better than it was before

### 🏗️ Conceptualisation & organisation
We have 2 key issues:
1. As a developer you will face new challenges quite often, on a daily basis some might say. And most importantly - they are right about it. Therefore, at some point you've got to ask yourself the question : "How do I tackle the mountain of a problem in front of me?"
<br /> <br />
2. During the past years I spent in startups, I often heard the phrases "This needs to be done asap", "quantity > quality" or most famously "time is money". This refers often to a short termed approach where a specific result is expected to be shipped as soon as possible, yesterday if possible. 


<br />
But how do we solve tasks, that have one or even both of those issues? The answer is a proper feature conceptualisation. If there are open questions about an assessment criteria or the expectations of either the client, product owner or contractor, there will most certainly be a clash when it comes to expectation vs. implementation. 
<br /> <br /> 
Let's solve those clashes before they come to life and experience your expectations fullfilled. Happy people, happy me ☀️
